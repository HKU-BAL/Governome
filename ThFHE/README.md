## ThFHE in Governome

In Governome, we have chosen homomorphic encryption for secure computation. In the example code, we have provided a case of multi-party collaboration to generate the public key and evaluation key based on the modules offered by [mp-spdz](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ). Please note that our code is merely a reference and is based on insecure [Toy parameters](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Governome/blob/main/auxiliary/tfhe.go#L11).
