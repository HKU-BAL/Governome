## Smart Contract in Ethereum

In Governome, we choose Ethereum as a tentative blockchain platform. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum is a programmable platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (DApps).

In Ethereum, smart contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met. Smart contracts on Ethereum are typically written in a programming language called Solidity.

Smart contracts enable trustless transactions, as they eliminate the need for intermediaries and rely on the decentralized nature of the blockchain. They provide transparency, security, and efficiency by executing automatically and precisely as programmed.

## How to run the code

You can turn to [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to execute the example code. We provide a comprehensive demonstration of the entire process of storing data, modifying consent, and processing queries using Governome. Through Governome, Data Owners can achieve absolute control over their own data. It is important to note that the provided code is merely a minimum viable demonstration, and its robustness has not been proven. In practical applications, considering factors such as throughput and usability, we recommend using Layer2 solutions or referring to [cosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to build a functional chain to accomplish Governome's functionalities at the blockchain level.
